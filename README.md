Code repo accompanying HiveMQ blog 'Underutilized MQTT5 features that enhance modern IoT data flows'

MQTT 5 introduces a range of features designed to improve the flexibility, efficiency, and functionality of the MQTT protocol, especially for IoT (Internet of Things) and high-frequency API applications. Key enhancements include the Topic Alias and the Request-Response Pattern, both of which aim to optimize messaging and enhance secure communication. 

This blog serves as a practical example of implementing some of the features discussed in the  Optimizing Data Cost Efficiency in MQTT-Based IoT and Connected Systems
